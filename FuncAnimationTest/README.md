### FuncAnimation Stuff

Don't worry about the tests folder, nothing there is of any interest as it was just some experiments.
main.py & main_w_text.py in the functional dir is where all the good stuff is. Very limited capability at the moment but
hey... we gotta start from somewhere.

FuncAnimation might be the way to go in terms of expanding this project. In general it seems to be 
more efficient at stitching the screenshots together, however, feel free to disagree.

If you want to save an animation remeber to install ffmpeg as mentioned in the comments of main.py

Let me know what you think once you've checked it out.
