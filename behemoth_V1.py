# I'm working on a completely different code set since we still need to merge the 3 different main versions. The side benefit might be that it gives me a new perspective. Will upload here soon. When this is done;

# IT IS TO BE MERGED WITH WHATEVER THE LATEST VERSION OF MAIN IS.
# I decided to take an approach more from scratch so as not to cause unecessary convolusion. Hopefully it makes it easier to understand the train of thought.
# Regardless should be easily mergable into main.

# I am trying to add some novel features though, like a progress bar.
