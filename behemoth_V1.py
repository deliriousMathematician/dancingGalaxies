# I'm working on a completely different set of code, hopefully gives me a new perspective. Will upload here soon. When this is done;

# IT IS TO BE MERGED WITH WHATEVER THE LATEST VERSION OF MAIN IS.

# Regardless should be easily mergable into main.

# I am trying to add some novel features though, like a progress bar.
