# To Do:
#   z_span:
#   - Implement save_frames for z_span
#   - zSpan Render but Abs (ie averages -ve and +ve values)
#   - ...
#
#   t_span_sph:
#   - Make Alignment Method Customizable
#   - Allow user to choose what components to animate (s, g, d)
#   - ptext
#   - Add Save_Frames Functionality
#   - prog_bar
#   - ...
#
#   t_span_stars:
#   - Add Customization Option to Axes
#   - Same stuff as in t_span_sph
#   - ...

# Bug Fixes:
#   - Animation now starts at 0.00 kpc
#   - FFmpeg saving animation properly, issue was with windows media player - use vlc
#   - ...

# Done:
#   - sideOn/faceOn view to be set by user before running function
#   - Much higher resolution thanks to adjustable dpi
#   - Defined both renderer and writer functions to handle animating
#   - Automatically determine vmin and vmax unless specified otherwise
#   - Allow custom Fig size to be chosen
#   - Allow the position of the pText to be changed
#   - Adjust starting zPos
#   - ...
