Repository User Guide:

- Imageio vs. Matplotlib FuncAnimation (and the used packages and libraries)
  
    This repository is based on the FuncAnimation class within Matplotlib animation to create the so-called movies. An alternative method may be the Imageio python library to create GIFs. Please find a sample use thereof in this repository; https://github.com/Karl-Caruana/dancingGalaxiesButGIFs/blob/main/astro_phy_gif_creator.py.

    Please note that this is not under development and is merely linked for those curious about alternative code methodologies. FuncAnimation was chosen as it seemed to be more versatile and generally applicable for our purposes.
